see the project and do what I tell you :
I want you to make OrdersView as page that has slidng filter that display orders by ,
first thing (recent orders ) as notifications and display thim as default , and tihn all orders , and pending orders thin archived orders and canceled orders ,
when I click in one of thim make it display orders as filtring ..

and design card for listing the orders as a widget in widgets folder ,
and when I tap or press on order details , I want to make it show and display the order info,
you can make it as a separated page or as bottom navigation bar , or pop up form , see what is better ..

and I want to get notification when order archived or complated,
and make the user go to the order details that has the notification and tap on it,
or you can build notification page in the app bar in home page that has search bar and other stuff , see witch is better and do it.


notes : always use StatelessWidget , just do the best at any thing..
